# self.image.set_colorkey()
# used to remove the background colour of the image
# neeed 1 positional argument that is the rgb value of the  colour that is in the background of image not window
needed only when the color of pygame windows is different than that of the image
since I am using grey theme I will not use self.bg_cp;pr and self.image.set_colorkey()
self.bg_color = (230, 230, 230)
self.image.set_colorkey(self.bg_color)
